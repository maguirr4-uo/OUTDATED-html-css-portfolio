# (OUTDATED) html-css-portfolio

I made this portfolio based on my resume sometime in summer 2022. It is now quite outdated, but I am leaving it here for reference.

UPDATE Jan 2025: I am aware that the Github Pages deployment for this is out of order. I am now working on remaking and updating the site instead of repairing the outdated one.
