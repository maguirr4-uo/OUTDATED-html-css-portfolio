# html-css-portfolio

I made this portfolio based on my resume sometime in summer 2022, but the virtual machine where it was stored was corrupted after performing an OS reinstallation. I finally got around to rescuing some files stored there, and decided to save them here.

As you can see, this is a very barebones skeleton of what I intended to make, but I will get around to improving it alongside my study of CSS and Javascript.
